        paragraph1: "The food we eat, the water we drink, the clothes we buy, and the electricity we use depend on sufficient amounts of clean, accessible water. When water flowing through rivers and streams drops to unusually low levels—termed “<a aria-label='Link to What is Streamflow Drought data visualization website' href='https://water.usgs.gov/vizlab/what-is-drought/' target='_blank'>streamflow drought</a>”—water managers may need to determine ways to allocate sufficient water to meet home, farm, business, and energy needs. To evaluate streamflow drought conditions, USGS developed Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) models that forecast streamflow drought up to 13 weeks (3 months) into the future (Carlisle, 2023; Hammond et al., 2025; McShane et al., 2025). Streamflow drought forecasts help decision makers anticipate periods of limited water availability so they can help develop plans for ensuring the safety and health of their communities.",

            paragraph1: "In order to interpret ‘unusually low` streamflow, we can compare streamflow conditions to conditions that are categorized as normal. For streamflow data, USGS scientists rely on <a aria-label='Link to Gages through the Ages data visualization website' href='https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/gages-through-the-ages/index.html' target='_blank'>long-term historical records</a> collected at <a aria-label='Link to USGS National Streamgaging Network website' href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/usgs-national-streamgaging-network' target='_blank'>thousands of USGS streamgage sites</a> across the United States. USGS scientists commonly summarize streamflow data into a mean daily value, which is the average streamflow for a single day. To understand how typical a mean daily streamflow value is, USGS scientists compare it to previous streamflow values on that same day in earlier years. For example, the chart below shows the observed streamflow values on April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025 over 112 years at one USGS streamgage (<a aria-label='Link to stream gage information on the Chippewa River Near Bruce, WI – 05356500' href='https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-05356500' target='_blank'>Chippewa River Near Bruce, WI – 05356500</a>).",

            paragraph2: "Streamflow values are categorized as normal, below normal, or above normal based on how often they occur. These frequency-based bins are called <span class ='emph'>percentiles</span>. For example, the observed streamflow at this site on April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2025, was 1,200 cubic feet per second (cfs, ~9,000 gallons per second). If streamflow at this site on April 12<sup>th</sup> is below 1,200 cfs in 20% of recorded years, then 1,200 cfs is the <span class ='emph'>20<sup>th</sup>-percentile streamflow</span> for that site on that date. Another way this can be stated is, at that site on April 12<sup>th</sup>, streamflow is less than 1,200 cfs 20% of the time.

When using a symmetric loss function, the model makes a median streamflow percentile prediction that follows the hydrograph well when the percentile is less than 30. When the penalty for underestimates decreases, the model is incentivized to predict lower streamflow percentiles. When the penalty for overestimates decreases, the model is incentivized to predict higher streamflow percentiles.",
            paragraph5: "What do you observe? When the left slope in the loss function is steeper than the right slope, meaning the function penalizes underestimation more strongly than overestimation, the model favors high predictions. Conversely, when the right slope is steeper than the left, the model favors low predictions. This approach allows the model to bracket the range of its predictions, capturing uncertainty in the forecast."

In this case, by excluding the 10% least likely prediction scenarios, the streamflow drought forecast model has a 90% prediction interval. The size of the prediction interval tells us the approximate percentage of actual observations <i>below the 30<sup>th</sup> percentile </i>the model expects to be within the interval. In other words, a 90% prediction interval should contain approximately 90% of observed streamflow values below the 30<sup>th</sup> percentile.",

When streamflow is below this line, the stream is considered to be in streamflow drought. When the stream enters and then exits drought, we consider that a single drought event. Four metrics are proposed that can describe each streamflow drought event. (1) Onset describes when the drought starts. (2) Termination describes when the drought ends.
